Teamspeak-Installer
===
To use my TeamSpeak-Installer, just copy the following line and paste it into your terminal.

<code>bash <(wget -O- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naspyy/teamspeak-installer/master/installer')</code>

Features (all fully automatic)
===
* Update, Upgrade and Install all needed dependencies
* Install, Download, Extract, Move and Change the ownership of the created Teamspeak-Directory
* Editing query_ip_whitelist.txt to allow Bots from ts3bot.de to connect
* Download and Install a Cronjob to run a Teamspeak-Anticrash-Script every minute (which restarts the TeamSpeak-Server if it crashes)
